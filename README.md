# ImageGear .NET Samples

These samples are intended to demonstrate how the various functions of ImageGear .NET can be used to perform imaging tasks. These samples are designed to be lightweight, concise, and show how ImageGear can be integrated into any application to perform these imaging tasks.

## How to Build these Samples

All samples can be built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or later. To build all the samples, use Visual Studio to open the samples.sln file in this directory. To build any individual sample, use Visual Studio to open the .sln file in the individual project directory. After opening the solution, select a Solution Configuration (Debug or Release) and a Solution Platform (x64 or x86). Last, build the complete solution with Build Solution located in the Build menu.

## How to Run these Samples

When the solution is built, it produces one or more console application executables in 'bin' subdirectories in the individual project directories. Run the sample application by double-clicking the application icon, or running it directly from Command Prompt (cmd.exe), PowerShell, or similar. Note that the working directory must be the same as the directory containing the sample executable in order to find the sample input image and the output directory. The input image(s) and output directory are specified relative to the location of the application in all of these samples.

## System Requirements

For a list of the system and development software necessary to build and run these samples, please refer to the [ImageGear .NET Online Documentation](https://help.accusoft.com/ImageGear-Net/latest/Windows/HTML/webframe.html#System_Requirements.html).

## __Improve image and document processing with ImageGear .NET.__

Our library supports more than 100 formats including images, DICOM, PDF, Microsoft Office files, and more. You can easily integrate a large number of complex imaging operations into C# applications and use our expanded functionality such as optical character recognition (OCR), barcode recognition, scanning, and support for medical DICOM images.

### Image Processing Algorithms

All the image processing functions you could ever need, all in one image processing library. Effortlessly control and distribute the exact functionality your .NET application needs. Source code samples and documentation snippets are available for your convenience to help you integrate complex imaging operations into your software.

### Compress and Optimize

Use our image processing library to compress and decompress images using with the best compression techniques in the industry including lossy, lossless, and progressive JPEG, JPEG 2000, CCITT, CCITT G3, CCITT G4, LZW, RLE, RAW, Packbits, and many others.

### Image Viewers and Display (HTML5 Viewer)

Create a true zero footprint file viewer capable of handling over 100 file formats including PDF, Word, Medical DICOM, just to mention a few. Our easy-to-use controls allow .NET developers to create web-based and mobile applications for document and image viewing, management, and processing using ImageGear’s ASP.NET HTML5 functionality.

### Supports PDF, Vector, Microsoft Office, and Images

View, convert, and edit more than 100 image file types including TIF, JPEG, JPEG2000, PNG, PDF, Microsoft Office (MS Word, PowerPoint, and Excel), CAD, DICOM, HD Photo, Camera RAW, and many more document and image formats.

### Image Capture, Scanning, and OCR

Add document scanning, printing, and processing directly into your application. Also, use our embedded OCR processing capabilities to extract text from images and export to text and PDF. Our .NET imaging library offers a comprehensive OCR component that includes support for Western and Asian languages. It can also fully integrate with any pre-processing cleanup technique available in ImageGear.

### Technical Support

Take advantage of Accusoft’s world class technical support team. Our engineers can answer technical questions and help you integrate state-of-the-art imaging algorithms into your .NET applications. You don’t have to be an image processing expert to use the best imaging algorithms in the industry.
