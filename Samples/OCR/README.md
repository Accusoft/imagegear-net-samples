# OCR Samples

These samples demonstrate the OCR functionality in ImageGear .NET.

## OCRUsingDictionary

A dictionary can be initialized from a text file as shown by this sample.

## OCRUsingLanguage

In order to best OCR the contents of a page, ImageGear can set the OCR language to improve recognition accuracy.

## OCRUsingZones

Before recognizing text, zones may be specified. If zones are specified, then the text recognized in each zone is provided separately.

## OCRToPDF

After ImageGear has recognized an imported raster image, it can then be used to create a PDF page as well as getting the recognized text.

## OCRToText

By extracting the text, the contents of the image can be used to control workflow without modifing the source image.
