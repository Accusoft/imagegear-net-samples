# OCR Using a Dictionary (OCRUsingDictionary)

When a raster image contains text with proper names or unusual words, ImageGear can use a dictionary to provide improved OCR accuracy.

A dictionary can be initialized from a text file as shown by this sample. The dictionary can also be updated with new words using the Flush method.

For more information about the ImageGear .NET API, please refer to the [ImageGear .NET Online Documentation](https://help.accusoft.com/ImageGear-Net/latest/Windows/HTML/webframe.html).

## System Requirements

For a list of the system and development software necessary to build and run these samples, please refer to the [ImageGear .NET Online Documentation](https://help.accusoft.com/ImageGear-Net/latest/Windows/HTML/webframe.html#System_Requirements.html).

## Building the Sample

All samples can be built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or later. To build this sample, open the .sln file in the project directory using Visual Studio, select a Solution Configuration (Debug or Release) and a Solution Platform (x64 or x86), and build with Build Solution located in the Build menu.  

## Running the Sample

When the sample is built, it produces a console application executable in the bin subdirectory. Run this application by double-clicking the application icon, or running it directly from Command Prompt (cmd.exe), PowerShell, or similar. Note that the working directory must be the same as the directory containing the sample executable in order to find the sample input image and the output directory. The input image(s) and output directory are specified relative to the location of the application in all of these samples.
