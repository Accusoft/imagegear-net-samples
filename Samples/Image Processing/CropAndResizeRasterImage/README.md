# Crop And Resize Raster Image (CropAndResizeRasterImage)

When a raster image the wrong size or needs to be enlarged or shrank, ImageGear can crop or resize the image as needed.

Once an image is loaded into ImageGear, it can be cropped. ImageGear crops independently on each side of the image, giving you complete control over what portion of the image to remove. An image can also be resized, which consists of creating more or fewer pixels to represent the same portion of the image. There are a number of options for how pixels are created and removed when resizing. See the ImageGear documentation for a list of interpolation options.

For more information about the ImageGear .NET API, please refer to the [ImageGear .NET Online Documentation](https://help.accusoft.com/ImageGear-Net/latest/Windows/HTML/webframe.html).

## System Requirements

For a list of the system and development software necessary to build and run these samples, please refer to the [ImageGear .NET Online Documentation](https://help.accusoft.com/ImageGear-Net/latest/Windows/HTML/webframe.html#System_Requirements.html).

## Building the Sample

All samples can be built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or later. To build this sample, open the .sln file in the project directory using Visual Studio, select a Solution Configuration (Debug or Release) and a Solution Platform (x64 or x86), and build with Build Solution located in the Build menu.  

## Running the Sample

When the sample is built, it produces a console application executable in the bin subdirectory. Run this application by double-clicking the application icon, or running it directly from Command Prompt (cmd.exe), PowerShell, or similar. Note that the working directory must be the same as the directory containing the sample executable in order to find the sample input image and the output directory. The input image(s) and output directory are specified relative to the location of the application in all of these samples.
