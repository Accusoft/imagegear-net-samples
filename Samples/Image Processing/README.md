# Image Processing Samples

These samples demonstrate select image processing capabilities of ImageGear .NET.

## CropAndResizeRasterImage

Once an image is loaded into ImageGear, it can be cropped. ImageGear crops independently on each side of the image, giving you complete control over what portion of the image to remove.

## DespeckleAndDeskewRasterImage

After an image is scanned, it is often slightly skewed, and can also contain "noise" in the background portion of the image. These can cause OCR to perform poorly. To correct these issues, load a raster image into ImageGear and use the Despeckle and Deskew functions to "fix" the image.
