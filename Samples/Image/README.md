# General Imaging Samples

These samples demonstrate general raster image functionality in ImageGear .NET.

## CompressUsingOptions

After an image is loaded, ImageGear provides functionality to manually set conversion and compression options before saving the image in JPEG format.

## CreateMetadata

This sample uses ImageGear Simplified Metadata API to add IPTC Photo Metadata fields to an existing JPEG image.

## DetectImageFormat

After a stream is loaded, ImageGear provides functionality to automatically detect an image's format.

## LoadingAndSaving

This sample demonstrates two of the most basic raster functions of ImageGear, loading and saving an image using the LoadPage and SavePage functions.

## LoadingWithLoadOptionsAndSaving

This sample demonstrates loading an image using basic LoadOptions and then saving the image using the SavePage functions.

## LoadRawImage

This sample demonstrates how to open images that do not have headers.

## MetadataGeneralAPI

After an image is loaded, ImageGear provides functionality to access both document and page level metadata.

## MetadataSimplifiedAPI

This sample demonstrates how to read, create, update, and delete metadata using the simplified metadata API in ImageGear.

## MetadataSimplifiedAPIUseArraysAndStructures

This sample shows recommended techniques when working with the Simplified Metadata API, using XMP.DublinCore.Subject as an example.

## SetFilterControlParametersGlobally

This sample shows how to use Filter Control Parameters to save a JPEG file with lossless compression instead of lossy compression.

## SimplifiedMetadataWithNullableFields

After an image is loaded, ImageGear provides the ability to access the metadata without knowing the tree or if the information exists.

## SpecifyColorProfilesGlobally

This sample shows how to implicitly use ICM color profiles to convert the color space in a JPEG image from RGB to CMYK.

## SpecifyColorProfilesLocally

This sample shows how to explicitly use ICM color profiles to convert the color space in a JPEG image from RGB to CMYK.
