# Set Filter Control Parameters Globally (SetFilterControlParametersGlobally)

Use Filter Control Parameters to customize how ImageGear reads and writes supported file formats.

Each ImageGear file format Filter provides a set of Control Parameters used when loading and saving examples of that file format.

For example, ImageGear saves JPEG files using lossy compression by default. This sample shows how to change the JPEG Filter Control Parameter `SaveType` so that ImageGear instead saves JPEG with lossless compression.

## System Requirements

For a list of the system and development software necessary to build and run these samples, please refer to the [ImageGear .NET Online Documentation](https://help.accusoft.com/ImageGear/latest/webframe.html#system-requirements.html).

## Building the Sample

Starting with ImageGear v26.0, ImageGear supports .NET Core.

All samples can be built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2022.

To build this sample:

1. Open the .sln file in the project directory using Visual Studio 2022.
2. Select a Solution Configuration (Debug or Release) and an available Solution Platform (x64 or Any CPU).
3. Build with Build Solution located in the Build menu.

To build this sample under Linux:

1. Install the Microsoft .NET SDK for your Linux distribution.
2. Run `dotnet build SetFilterControlParametersGlobally.sln`. By default this will build the Debug Solution Configuration.

## Running the Sample

When the sample is built, it produces a console application executable in the bin subdirectory. Run this application by double-clicking the application icon, or run it directly from Command Prompt (cmd.exe), PowerShell, or similar. Note that the working directory must be the same as the directory containing the sample executable in order to find the sample input image and the output directory. The input image(s) and output directory are specified relative to the location of the application in all of these samples.

To run this sample under Linux, run the sample from "bin/Debug/net6.0/" (depending on the solution platform) using `./SetFilterControlParametersGlobally`.
