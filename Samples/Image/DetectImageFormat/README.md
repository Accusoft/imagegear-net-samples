# Detect Image Format (DetectImageFormat)

When you need to detect the format of an image, ImageGear can provide the needed information.

After a stream is loaded, ImageGear provides functionality to automatically detect an image's format. The information can be accessed through a set of properties which are all used in this sample.

For more information about the ImageGear .NET API, please refer to the [ImageGear .NET Online Documentation](https://help.accusoft.com/ImageGearMP/latest/webframe.html).

## System Requirements

For a list of the system and development software necessary to build and run these samples, please refer to the [ImageGear .NET Online Documentation](https://help.accusoft.com/ImageGearMP/latest/webframe.html#system-requirements.html).

## Building the Sample

Starting with ImageGear v26.0, ImageGear supports .NET Core.

All samples can be built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2022.

To build this sample:

1. Open the .sln file in the project directory using Visual Studio 2022.
2. Select a Solution Configuration (Debug or Release) and an available Solution Platform (x64 or Any CPU).
3. Build with Build Solution located in the Build menu.

To build this sample under Linux:

1. Install the Microsoft .NET SDK for your Linux distribution.
2. Run `dotnet build DetectImageFormat.sln`. By default this will build the Debug Solution Configuration.

## Running the Sample

When the sample is built, it produces a console application executable in the bin subdirectory. Run this application by double-clicking the application icon, or run it directly from Command Prompt (cmd.exe), PowerShell, or similar. Note that the working directory must be the same as the directory containing the sample executable in order to find the sample input image and the output directory. The input image(s) and output directory are specified relative to the location of the application in all of these samples.

To run this sample under Linux, run the sample from "bin/Debug/net6.0/" (depending on the solution platform) using `./DetectImageFormat`.
