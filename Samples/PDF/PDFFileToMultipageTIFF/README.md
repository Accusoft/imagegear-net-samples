# Convert PDF File To Multipage TIFF (PDFFileToMultipageTIFF)

When a PDF file needs to be a raster image file, ImageGear can rasterize the pages of a PDF file and save them to a multipage raster image file.

Converting a PDF file to a raster image format is very easy with ImageGear. After opening the PDF document, simply save the document to a raster image format that supports multiple pages.

For more information about the ImageGear .NET API, please refer to the [ImageGear .NET Online Documentation](https://help.accusoft.com/ImageGear/latest/webframe.html).

## System Requirements

For a list of the system and development software necessary to build and run these samples, please refer to the [ImageGear .NET Online Documentation](https://help.accusoft.com/ImageGear/latest/webframe.html#system-requirements.html).

## Building the Sample

Starting with ImageGear v26.0, ImageGear supports .NET Core.

All samples can be built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2022. To build this sample, open the .sln file in the project directory using Visual Studio, select a Solution Configuration (Debug or Release) and an available Solution Platform (x64 or x86), and build with Build Solution located in the Build menu.  

To build this sample under Linux, first install the Microsoft .NET SDK for your Linux distribution. After that, run `dotnet build PDFFileToMultipageTIFF.dotnet.sln`. By default this will build the Debug Solution Configuration.

## Running the Sample

When the sample is built, it produces a console application executable in the bin subdirectory. Run this application by double-clicking the application icon, or running it directly from Command Prompt (cmd.exe), PowerShell, or similar. Note that the working directory must be the same as the directory containing the sample executable in order to find the sample input image and the output directory. The input image(s) and output directory are specified relative to the location of the application in all of these samples.

To run this sample under Linux, run the sample from "bin/x64/Debug/net6.0/" using `./PDFFileToMultipageTIFF.dotnet`.
