# Merge Two PDF Files (MergeTwoPDFFiles)

When multiple PDF files need to be merged, ImageGear can insert pages from one PDF document into a different PDF document.

Any PDF document can have pages from other PDF documents inserted into it. The InsertPages function can insert a range of pages. This function can also be used to take a new PDF document and populate it with pieces of other PDF documents.

## System Requirements

For a list of the system and development software necessary to build and run these samples, please refer to the [ImageGear .NET Online Documentation](https://help.accusoft.com/ImageGear-Net/latest/Windows/HTML/webframe.html#System_Requirements.html).

## Building the Sample

All samples can be built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or later. To build this sample, open the .sln file in the project directory using Visual Studio, select a Solution Configuration (Debug or Release) and a Solution Platform (x64 or x86), and build with Build Solution located in the Build menu.  

## Running the Sample

When the sample is built, it produces a console application executable in the bin subdirectory. Run this application by double-clicking the application icon, or running it directly from Command Prompt (cmd.exe), PowerShell, or similar. Note that the working directory must be the same as the directory containing the sample executable in order to find the sample input image and the output directory. The input image(s) and output directory are specified relative to the location of the application in all of these samples.
