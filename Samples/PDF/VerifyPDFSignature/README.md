# Verify a PDF Signature (VerifyPDFSignature)

When a PDF is digitally signed, ImageGear can verify that the digital signature is valid.

After providing certificates to ImageGear, all the signatures in a PDF document can be verified at once with the VerifySignatures function. You can also use the Signatures property of the PDF document to verify each signature separately and get information about each signature.

For more information about the ImageGear .NET API, please refer to the [ImageGear .NET Online Documentation](https://help.accusoft.com/ImageGear-Net/latest/Windows/HTML/webframe.html).

## System Requirements

For a list of the system and development software necessary to build and run these samples, please refer to the [ImageGear .NET Online Documentation](https://help.accusoft.com/ImageGear-Net/latest/Windows/HTML/webframe.html#System_Requirements.html).

## Support for .NET core

Starting with ImageGear v26.0, ImageGear supports .NET Core. To build this sample using .NET Core, open the .dotnet.sln file in the project directory using Visual Studio 2017 or later. Follow the instructions below to build and run the sample.

## Building the Sample

All samples can be built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or later. To build this sample, open the .sln file in the project directory using Visual Studio, select a Solution Configuration (Debug or Release) and a Solution Platform (x64 or x86), and build with Build Solution located in the Build menu.  

## Running the Sample

When the sample is built, it produces a console application executable in the bin subdirectory. Run this application by double-clicking the application icon, or running it directly from Command Prompt (cmd.exe), PowerShell, or similar. Note that the working directory must be the same as the directory containing the sample executable in order to find the sample input image and the output directory. The input image(s) and output directory are specified relative to the location of the application in all of these samples.

_**NOTE:** ImageGear .NET runs in evaluation mode if started without a license and will periodically display a dialog that requires interaction before proceeding.
