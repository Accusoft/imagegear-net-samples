# PDF AcroForm Samples

These samples demonstrate PDF AcroForm support in ImageGear .NET.

## AddingWidgets

ImageGear allows adding widgets (radio button, checkboxes, listboxes, etc.) to PDF AcroForms.

## CreatePDFFormField

Starting with a PDF document, new or existing, first the PDF document is set to contain forms. Then form controls can be added to any page in the PDF document.

## FlattenPDFFormFields

ImageGear allows the form fields in a PDF document to be converted into content on the pages so that the fields are no longer interactive.

## ModifyFieldAppearance

This sample demonstrates how to accentuate a widget to fit better in the PDF form, or to emphasize important items.

## ReadPDFFormFields

This sample demonstrates how to read the values from form fields. ImageGear provides methods and properties to read current and default values or arrays of values from AcroForm fields.

## SetPDFFormFields

This sample demonstrates how to set the values of form fields and save those values to a PDF file. ImageGear provides methods and properties to set current values or arrays of values for AcroForm fields.
